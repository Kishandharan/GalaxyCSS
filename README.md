## CommonCSS file
This file is used when advanced and specfic themes are not required.                                                
This contains common CSS styles which can be used for customizing the styles of many elements to your liking.                            
Below are the themes and styles present in this file:                                                    

### fontSize_1rem ... fontSize_10rem                                   
These classes apply font sizes to your website.                                 
For example, "fontSize_1rem" sets a element's font size to 1rem                                                               
and "fontSize_2rem" sets it to two rem and so on till fontSize_10rem.                                                    

### transition_1E                                                                                                                           
This class applies transition to elements which use transition compatible styles.                                          
The transition has a duration of 1 second and a speed type of ease.                                                  

### transition_1L
Similar to the transition_1E class, it also applies transition to elements, but uses a speed type of linear.                      
Meant to be used for animations which have to be very consistent in speed.
